### Notice [2012.08.20] ###

  * REGA is the tool developed (without any open sources related to registry analysis) by our academic research center; [DFRC](http://forensic.korea.ac.kr).
  * We had intended to provide the useful software for efficient digital forensics.
  * Because REGA is not an open-source software, the lite version is provided only.
  * Although the lite version has some functional restrictions, it is also useful for digital forensic purposes. And the functions for lite version will be enhanced continuously.
  * Under the open project policies, the tools will be re-posted to the new website asap.
  * This site will soon close.
